Quick review:

A Future<T> instance produces a value of type T.
If a future doesn’t produce a usable value, then the future’s type is Future<void>.
A future can be in one of two states: uncompleted or completed.
When you call a function that returns a future, the function queues up work to be done and returns an uncompleted future.
When a future’s operation finishes, the future completes with a value or with an error.
